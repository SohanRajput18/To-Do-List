Developed a To-Do List Application in C++:
Designed and implemented a command-line based To-Do List application using C++.

File Handling for Persistent Storage:
Utilized file operations to read tasks from and write tasks to a text file, ensuring task persistence between application runs.

Task Management Functionalities:
Implemented functionalities to add, view, update, and delete tasks within the application.

Dynamic Task Loading and Saving:
Created functions to dynamically load tasks from a file at startup and save tasks to the file after every modification.

User Interaction and Input Validation:
Designed an interactive menu-driven interface for seamless user interaction.
Included input validation to handle invalid task numbers and empty task lists effectively.

Exception Handling for Robust File Operations:
Incorporated exception handling to manage potential errors during file operations, ensuring program robustness and reliability.
Use of Standard Library for Efficient Coding:

Leveraged C++ Standard Library components such as vectors and file streams to build an efficient and maintainable codebase.
